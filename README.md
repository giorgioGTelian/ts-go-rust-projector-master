# Be careful!
the solution for the code in poliglot programming Go-Rust-Typescript

### This is the exact code from my front end masters course.

### A word of warning
I intentionally used non standard descriptions or terms for things.  One thing
that really sticks out is pointing out that options have the map function which
allows them to be inserted into iterator chains.  that is not technically true,
but I felt that it was the easiest way to consume the idea for a dev coming
from TypeScript.


Hate the language, not the player
